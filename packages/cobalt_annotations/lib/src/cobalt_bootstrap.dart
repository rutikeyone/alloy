/// finish before anything can be resolved, such as `WidgetsFlutterBinding`,
/// FFI setup or reading a config file.

/// Nothing can be injected into a bootstrap step, because there is no
/// container yet. A constructor with required parameters is rejected at build
/// time and flagged in the IDE by `cobalt_bootstrap_step_cannot_inject`. Work
/// that needs dependencies belongs in an [CobaltInit] service instead.
///

/// @CobaltBootstrap(order: -10)

///   BindPlatform();
///
///   @override
