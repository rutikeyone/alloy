  /// package's annotations, so anything registered by hand is invisible to it:
  /// a scope builder that wraps `$AlloyRootScope` and adds to it, or a
  /// provider from another package. Name those here.
  ///
  /// An element is either a `Type`, or an [AlloyProvided] when the
  /// hand-written registration is named:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @AlloyScopeRoot(name: 'app', provides: [SessionManager])
  /// class AppScope {
  ///   const AppScope();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This is a promise, not a registration — nothing is emitted for it. Listing
  /// something nothing registers moves the failure back to startup, which is
  /// where it was before.
